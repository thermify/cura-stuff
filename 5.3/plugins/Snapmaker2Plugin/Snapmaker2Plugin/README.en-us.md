# Troubleshooting Snapmaker Discovery
⚠️ If your snapmaker name or IP address does not appear try the following steps:
   1. Ensure you snapmaker is connected to wifi by checking your wireless router or checking on the Snapmakers touchscreen
   2. Wait 5-10 seconds, Cura continuously looks for all compatible devices in the LAN and displays them automatically
   3. Restart Snapmaker 2 (poweroff for **at least 15 seconds**) and wait for touchscreen to fully start and ensure it is connected to the right wireless lan
   4. Check your computer's firewall to see if Cura access to the local area network is blocked (win10 is blocked by default)
   5. Check the router settings to see if UDP broadcasting is blocked
   6. If possible, make sure that your computer and the Snapmaker 2 have good wifi reception with your router to eliminate the chance of network issues.

Please note that the instructions above are valid on firmware 1.12.1 and 1.12.3; touchscreen UI flows do vary by version; also as of writing wifi network connecitvity of the A350 can be unreliable.
