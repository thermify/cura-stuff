# OrientationPlugin

Before downloading; Check if you are using the right branch! Certain versions of this plugin won't work with certain versions of Cura. If there is a matching branch, use that one.

The orientation plugin is a simple wrapper around the excellent STL-Tweaker by Christoph Schranz. It allows you to quickly calculate and apply the best printable orientation directly from Cura.
